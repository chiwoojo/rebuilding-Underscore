# Rebuilt the Underscore.js library (a good chunk) from scratch

I rebuilt a good chunk of Underscore.js library from scratch using functional programming technique. 

Through this exercise, I upped my functional programming and callbacks skills. 

Rebuilt functions: 
```javascript
_.last
_.each
_.filter
_.reject
_.uniq
_.map
_.reduce
_.contains
_.every
_.some
_.extend
```

There were parts that I pair-programmed with Jason Arkens :) but mostly I solved it myself.
